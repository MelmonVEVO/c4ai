# c4ai
A Connect Four game implemented in Python. Allows play versus a human, a bot, or two bots playing against each other.
The bot uses [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) for deciding where to place pieces. It saves its tree every time the game is closed.

To play, run `view.py`
